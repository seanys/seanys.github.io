I am Yang Shan(羊山), a PhD student in ISEM, National University of Singapore (NUS). Currently, I am working on applying DRL to traffic management and information dissemination problem in the mixed traffic flow environment with connected vehicles and regular vehicles. When I was studying at Tongji Unviversity, I also worked on some optimization problems in taxipooling and 2D irregular packing.
