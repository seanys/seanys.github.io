I am Yang Shan (羊山), a PhD candidate in ISEM at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Currently, I am working on applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to congestion management in mixed traffic flow environments, focusing on both connected and regular vehicles. While studying at Tongji University, I also worked on optimization problems in taxi pooling and 2D irregular packing.
